#My Python Notes#

Created by Guido van Rossum (Dutch programmer)

Open source

Then developed continuosly by community

Additions Cython (C python) Rython (Reduced - subset of python for self development) & Jython (Java python)

Interpreter language such as Java Perl & Python

Compiler language C & Go (good for fast mathemeatical calculations)

#Function(print), parenthares(()), quotations (intiate string), closing of both ("))
#All but the function make up the 'function invocation'
#All but the function and the parenthares make up the 'argument'
print("Hello this is christopher")

#Within a string \n indicates a new output line
#E.g:       print("Hello\nfriend.")
Displays:   Hello
            friend.
#Seperate multiple arguments like so (They are printed individually with no commas displayed):
print("The itsy bitsy spider" , "climbed up" , "the waterspout.")

#Keyword argument - 'end' is keyword and requires =
#Below code prints: My name is Python. Monty Python.
print("My name is", "Python.", end=" ")
print("Monty Python.")

1. The print() function is a built-in function. It prints/outputs a specified message to the screen/consol window.

2. Built-in functions, contrary to user-defined functions, are always available and don't have to be imported. Python 3.7.1 comes with 69 built-in functions. You can find their full list provided in alphabetical order in the Python Standard Library.

3. To call a function (function invocation), you need to use the function name followed by parentheses. You can pass arguments into a function by placing them inside the parentheses. You must separate arguments with a comma, e.g., print("Hello,", "world!"). An "empty" print() function outputs an empty line to the screen.

4. Python strings are delimited with quotes, e.g., "I am a string", or 'I am a string, too'.

5. Computer programs are collections of instructions. An instruction is a command to perform a specific task when executed, e.g., to print a certain message to the screen.

6. In Python strings the backslash (\) is a special character which announces that the next character has a different meaning, e.g., \n (the newline character) starts a new output line.

7. Positional arguments are the ones whose meaning is dictated by their position, e.g., the second argument is outputted after the first, the third is outputted after the second, etc.

8. Keyword arguments are the ones whose meaning is not dictated by their location, but by a special word (keyword) used to identify them.

9. The end and sep parameters can be used for formatting the output of the print() function. The sep parameter specifies the separator between the outputted arguments (e.g., print("H", "E", "L", "L", "O", sep="-"), whereas the end parameter specifies what to print at the end of the print statement.

#Can simplify by adding op to left side of operator
variable = variable op expression
x = x * 2

variable op= expression
